    "rules": "The goal of the game is to uncover all the squares that do not contain mines without being 'blown up'. Clicking on the game board will reveal what is hidden underneath the chosen square (a large number of blank squares may be revealed in one go if they are adjacent to each other). Some squares are blank but some contain numbers (1-8), each number being the number of mines adjacent to the uncovered square. To help avoid hitting a mine, the location of a suspected mine can be marked by a flag by right clicking on the square. The game is won once all blank squares have been uncovered without hitting a mine.",

The foundations are built up by suit (Ace to Kings) while the cards on the tableau are built down, by alternating color (card suit is irrelevant on the tableau). Any spaces in the tableau are immediately filled by the top card of the wastepile (bottom row, right pile), or if none are present, the top card of the stock (bottom row, left pile). The stock is dealt one card at a time (by clicking on the stock pile) onto the wastepile, the top card of which is available for play to the tableau or the foundations. The game is won when all cards are built onto the foundation piles.",

It is not related to another similarly named solitaire game of Rouge et Noir (French for red and black), although Red and Black can also be known under that name.",

The cards in the pack are turned over from the hand one at a time. They can be played to a foundation, or to any of four waste piles below each foundation. These waste piles can be arranged so that eacch card can be seen. The top card of each waste pile is available for play to a foundation pile at any time.

    "rules": "The object is to build all cards onto the foundations in suits and in ascending order up to Kings and then Aces onwards. Cards are built onto the tableau piles in descending order of rank and in opposite colors. A tableau pile may be played onto another as a whole unit. The top card in a tableau pile is available for play to a foundation. If a space in the tableau becomes empty it is filled immediately by the top card of the heel, when the next card in the heel is turned face up. The cards in the hand are turned up in packets of three at a time, and are played to the table to form the talon. The top card of the talon is available for play to the foundations or to the tableau. It is not mandatory to play a card from the talon- a player might wish to wait for another round. When all the cards in the hand have been played to the talon and all building completed, the talon is turned over and taken into hand again and the process repeated. The hand/talon is never shuffled. If the heel becomes exhausted, then spaces in the tableau may be filled by the top card in the talon, but not necessarily immediately- a player may wish for a more suitable card to become available. Play continues until the game is worn or until the whole hand has been played to the talon without it being possible to play any cards to the layout.",

The game is also known as Facination and Thirteen.",
